Devel/Carnivore version 0.08
============================

This module allows you to debug your hashes and, in particular, your objects 
based on hashes without using the perl debugger. There are several good reasons
to do this. Among them:
1) You're too stupid to use the perl debugger (This is true for me)
2) You're building web applications and the perl debugger doesn't work very
well in that environment

Obviously, this module does not provide you with a complete debugger. All it does
is keeping track of the state changes which occur to your objects. You will get
a series of lines which look similar to this:

ProgLang: "cool" changed from "Java" to "Perl"  at devel.pl line 30

So what does this tell you?

You have a Perl file named devel.pl. On line 30 your code changed the value of the 
key "cool" from "Java" to "Perl". In order, to identify this hash you optionally
named it "ProgLang".
